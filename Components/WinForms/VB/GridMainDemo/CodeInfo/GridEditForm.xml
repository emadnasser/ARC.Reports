        <description>This Grid control uses a custom EditForm for data editing, which is represented by an EditFormUserControl descendant (defined in the AdvancedEditForm module). Editors used to edit data are arranged within the EditForm with the help of the LayoutControl, which provides layout management capabilities. In the AdvancedEditForm module, you can see how the editors are bound to corresponding data source fields via the BoundFieldName extender property.</description>
