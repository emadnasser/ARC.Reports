So much so, that even Microsoft recommend using it with your ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC sites. Join Julian in the first of an occasional series as he explores what jQuery provides for DOM access. This session will be about the very basics of jQuery usage, but will take the time to show off some of the nifty things you can do.

      Subject="Improving Web Site Performance and Scalability While Saving Money"
      Description="Can you really improve the customer experience and save money? There are many simple techniques and free tools available that can do both! This session will start with a traditional ASP.NET web site and show step by step how to improve it for both client experience and cost savings. Review the basics of caching and learn how to avoid costly server round trips by using expirations to maximize use of the client's browser and also reduce server side execution time with data caching on the server. Use HTTP compression, minification of JavaScript and CSS, server side viewstate, and image optimization to reduce client downloads by 50-75%. Take advantage of free CDN networks to host jQuery and Ajax files. See how tools such as Ajax Minifier, Fiddler, Network Monitor, and Google Page speed can be used to help diagnose and verify improvements."

    <Session
      Subject="RESTful Services with ASP.NET MVC"
      Description="REST is the architecture of the Web, and RESTful Web services are now the most popular way of enabling browser-based applications to access information and behavior on Web servers. In Web 2.0 applications, desktop-like responsiveness and versatility are driven by client-side script code, and RESTful services with JavaScript-friendly request and response formats vastly simplify this kind of code. Open source frameworks like Rails have historically made the server side of these services correspondingly straightforward to implement, but the .NET community hasn’t benefitted from this kind of work until recently. Now, however, ASP.NET MVC (itself an open source project), along with the modest assistance of some other open-source tools and conventions, makes it easy to write full-featured RESTful Web services. We’ll explore REST itself, what RESTful Web services look like, and how to write them using the MVC framework along with Steve Hodgkiss’s RESTful Routing library."

      Subject="Async from scratch, from a language lover's perspective"
      Description="You've probably seen some of the excitement around the 'async' feature of C# 5, but how does it all work under the hood? What does it mean when we say we're registering a continuation to run when a task completes? How much behaviour is actually prescribed by the language?

			  In a shocking break from other presentations, I may well attempt to talk about async without the safety net of a flashy GUI. Instead, we'll create some very simple supposedly-asynchronous code, some of which won't even do anything asynchronous at all. Just don't tell the compiler. Who needs AsyncCTP.dll when we can write our own GetAwaiter method?

			  If we have time, I'll also give some examples of extra building blocks we can use in a compositional way to make our async life simpler."
