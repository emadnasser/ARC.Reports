                (<b>Jupiter II</b>), is the smallest of its four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons" title="Galilean moons">Galilean satellites</a>,
                but still the sixth-largest moon in the

                and was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(mythology)" title="Europa (mythology)">Europa</a>, mother of king <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos" title="Minos">Minos</a>

                and by space probe flybys starting in the 1970s.

                    Slightly smaller than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a>, Europa is primarily made of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate" title="Silicate">silicate</a>
                    rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron%E2%80%93nickel_alloy" title="Iron–nickel alloy">iron–nickel</a>
                    core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare. It has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System.
                    The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>
                    ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for

                <p>
                    Europa has emerged as one of the top locations in the Solar System in terms of
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability" title="Planetary habitability">potential habitability</a> and the possibility of hosting
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">life</a>.
                    Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent" title="Hydrothermal vent">hydrothermal vents</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endolith" title="Endolith">
                        endoliths
                    </a> are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and
                    bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. However, if Europa's ocean were too cold,
                    biological processes similar to those known
                    on Earth could not take place. Similarly, if it were too salty, only extreme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halophile" title="Halophile">halophiles</a>
                    could survive in its environment.

                <p>
                    Evidence suggests the existence of lakes of liquid water entirely encased in Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to
                    exist farther down beneath the ice shell. If confirmed, the lakes could be yet another potential habitat for life.
